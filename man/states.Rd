\details{
\code{gpz} represents a geopolitical zone which, in the Nigerian 
context, is a national subdivision that groups contiguous states that bear
certain socio-cultural and political similarities. Historically, they arise
from sub-national administrative divisions known as 'Regions' that existed 
at the time of the country's independence. There are at present 6 such 
zones - North-Central, North-East, North-West, South-East,South-South and 
South-West.
